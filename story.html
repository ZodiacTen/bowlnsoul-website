      <h2>Rooted in Friendship, Spices, and Soul</h2>
      <p>
        Bowl n Soul was born from shared meals between friends from South Indian and Bangladeshi backgrounds, where spices, noodles, and rice brought our cultures together. What started as quick lunches at work turned into an idea: create bowls that combine comfort, culture, and street food soul.
      </p>

      <p>
        With over six years in London’s vibrant food scene, we now serve at markets like Victoria Park and Lloyd Park. Our bowls reflect the diversity of South Asia — from turmeric ghee rice and scrambled paneer to South Asian-style noodles with grilled meats or veggies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our food is freshly made, served fast, and prepared with care. We are proud holders of a 5-star hygiene rating, and every bowl is built to nourish, comfort, and excite your tastebuds.
